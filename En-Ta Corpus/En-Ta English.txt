Vision of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority  
Paying the country’s respect and gratitude embodying the name "Ranaviru” 
Our Mission Statement  
Planning and operation of welfare services for the settlement of psycho-social and social issues faced by the family members of those missing, killed of disabled in action in the Armed Services and Police in defending the country and the people and creating a mental awakening of those heroes presently in service. 
Preamble 
The Ranaviru Sewa Authority was established by the Parliamentary act of no 54 1999.
Since its inception to date in the 12 years of existence the Authority has marched forward overcoming various obstacles and difficulties during this limited period of time but gained huge experiences that are incomparable.
There are a lot of unique reasons for the emergence of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority when one looks into its functions. 
The functions of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority are really supreme in the context of provision of a strong helping hand for the continuation of the future lives of children, wives and parents of  the gallant war heroes who sacrificed their lives or those  missing or lost their limbs in the fight of liberating our motherland from the cruel terrorism that was under the influence of specially both local and overseas conspirators  and  with a view to protect the liberty of the people and the country, their dignity, sovereignty and the territorial integrity. 
During the year 2011, the Ranaviru Sewa Authority implemented a number of projects and programmes to discharge this supreme functions and I state with gratitude to all those who supported in this endeavor that it reflects the collective efforts of all of us rendered for the provision of the significant service for the Rananiru community amidst various difficulties.
Focus was made during this year on organizing programmes of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority that did  not hider to  the corporate plan and the working programme of the Authority.
I am confident that all the experiences we had during this period would be very useful to achieve a more systematic and constructive progress in the coming year. 
To reach the expected heist in performances of an institution will depend on the parallel functioning of namely three areas of functions of the institution, the team and its personnel who make arrangements to make the functions a reality.
To elaborate, due to the non-identification of the role and inability to make it a success through collective efforts causes divisions in the group.
Development of such divisions in an institution may result in a negative impact on the whole functioning of the institution, following a breakdown of the trend of satisfying individual members of the group. 
We in the Ranaviru Sewa Authority, have understood this situation clearly and have made arrangements to discharge  the functions of the Authority systematically, this will result in the morale of the individual vying to high a level while mobilizing the collective efforts of the staff as a specific objective to achieve next year. 
The most important step that has been initiated in this regard is the reorganization of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority staff to make that structure more constructive and suit the modern requirements.
Steps are being taken to implement it next year.

The majority of applicants who applied for the medical relief loan programme during the last years were war heroes in service. 
There is a decline in the  of number of requests for Medical Relief Loans received this year in comparison to other years, This is due to  Army welfare unit introducing a special medical loan programme in 2011 for members of the army in service.

III. Educational scholarships project 
Introduction 
The Educational project of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority is operative in view of helping the children of war heroes who have died, missing, retired disabled while engaged in action for safeguarding the country and the people, and those who are presently in the services, to continue their education up to their higher education successfully . 
The scholarships categories 
1. Ranaviru children savings investment scholarships 
This scheme commenced in 2005 in collaboration with the National Savings Bank.
It also expected to improve their savings habit as this system allows the account holder to make private contributions to it.
This money is meant for the education of the children concerned and not for the enhancement of the family income. 
Most of the Ranaviru children presently belong to the lower age group and they enter the higher classes at the time of retirement of the War hero after completion of his service period of 12 or 22 years.
Further with the retirement of the War hero the family income declines. 
This happens at a time they need much money for the education of the child. 
It is imperative, to be prepared with, some form of investment being made for these children considering these facts.
As an initial step, this programme covering Ranaviru children who have shown remarkable results, is carried out in collaboration with the National Savings Bank, a leading state bank in the saving sector.

11. Land Project 
Introduction 
Provision of shelter to the relevant families is a very special and complex aspect in delivering the services of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority for the benefit of war heroes and their families. 
In most cases war heroes and their families encountered difficulties in finding places (land) to build houses even though encouragement with providing financial facilities are made available to get a suitable house built for living through the Housing and concessionary loan scheme. 
Non- availability of a block of land is a barrier to secure other welfare requirements. 
The land unit of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority took this situation into consideration making arrangements to provide blocks of land to war heroes and also helped indirectly to find them land for housing

Conclusion 
 
The motive of the Ranaviru Sewa Authority is making the tomorrow of these respectable children a better and secured one.
We consider that the steps taken by the Ranaviru Sewa Authority to make its action plan more result-oriented for accomplishing its aim of meeting needs of war heroes is an achievement in 2011. 
One remarkable feature that was highlighted in 2011 was the implementation of hither to scattered project fields bringing under five principal categories in conformity to the vision of paying gratitude of the nation to the ranaviru name.
We believe that as a result of this action we were able to fulfill the necessities of war heroes more effectively.
The staff of the authority while working with minimum facilities have set an example by extending their services with dedication to achieve goals.
Since we have taken several steps to improve the status of Office building and staff we expect that we would be able to provide more efficient and useful service for the Ranaviru community. 
The Ranaviru Sewa Authority also focuses on improving skills and education of Ranaviru children.
Accordingly actions were initiated to advance the Ranaviru children’s language knowledge particularly English knowledge, cultural programmes were conducted in Ranviru villages with a view to improve aesthetic skills, and streamlined computer courses for them. 

We are pleased to state that we will continue our task of creating a better living condition that care for the dignity of Ranaviru community of the nation who have completed a very difficult but a responsible task with dedication that protected the supreme liberty, sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity of Sri Lanka and have ensured the protection and security of all communities while setting an example to other countries.

Customs Officers Reward Fund - 2012 
1. Financial Statements 
1.1. Opinion 
In my opinion, except for the effect of the matter described in paragraph 1.2 of this report, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Customs Officers Reward Fund as at 31 December 2012 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

3. Operating Review 
3.1. Performance 
A 50 per cent portion of the Government tax revenue, penalties imposed, confiscated money, and proceeds of the sale of confiscated goods, etc. imposed on illegal actions such as the Customs tax frauds, illegal imports, breach of regulations on import control detected by the Customs Officers are credited to this Fund for the payment of rewards of the officers and the informants. 
According to the information furnished, the particulars of income, expenditure, and the net operating results for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the 6 preceding years are given below.

Total Expenditure Surplus/ (Deficit) 
Payments to Officers

Others 
The following observations are made.
The money not collected by the officers from the lists of rewards issued by the Department from time to time is credited to this account. 
When those officers make subsequent claims for the money, such payments are debited to this account. 
Nevertheless, it was observed that proper steps had not been taken on the unsettled amounts remaining over long periods relating to the re-deposited rewards. 
3.2. Transactions of Contentious Nature 
The following observations are made. 
(a) Sri Lanka Customs had not taken the instructors of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenues into consideration in deducting the Pay As You Earn Tax on the rewards paid to the officers. 
Actions had been taken by considering the rewards paid as one off payment, but in the cases of payment in several instances, those had not been accumulated and the final amount of tax that should be charged had not been computed. 
A large amount of tax revenue receivable by the Government had been deprived of to the Government due to the separate computation of the Pay As You Earn Tax and recovering only the relevant amount of that payment in the case of payment of rewards in several instances.
The unavailability of a proper procedure for the accurate computation of the tax to the Government from the Customs officers receiving a number of allowances is a contentious matter.  
(b) In terms of the section 153(2) of the Customs (Amendment) Act, No. 83 of 1988, regulations have been made in such manner to enable the allocation of 50 per cent of the balance of fines income for the Reward Fund once all expenses are deducted and to distribute them to officers and informants as gifts. 
Accordingly, though the overtime paid from the Fund to all officers who conducted the investigation should be deducted from the fines income, it had not been so done and brought to account as an expenditure of the Customs Overtime Fund. 
As records of the overtime cost on the investigations had not been separately maintained, the overtime cost incurred on investigations could not be computed. 
(c) According to the prevailing Customs Rewards Scheme, the payment of rewards to the officers is not made only from the fines imposed on the parties involved in Customs Duty frauds, but also from 50 per cent of the tax receivable by the Government from those parties. 
Therefore, the responsible parties have not paid their attention to the contribution for the protection of the public Revenue. 
(d) It has been pointed out from time to time in the audit that there have been numerous instances where Customs officers have been rewarded with tax revenues and penalties levied from various parties without special customs investigation. 
Therefore, such heavy expenditure incurred by the Fuel Fund for the Departmental fuel expenditure under such circumstances is a contentious matter in the audit. 
4. Accountability and Good Governance 
4.1. Budgetary Control 
Significant variances were observed between the budgeted and the actual income and expenditure for the year under review, thus indicating that the budget had not been made use of as an effective instrument of control. 
5. Systems and Controls 
Deficiencies observed during the course of the audit were brought to the notice of the Director General of Customs from time to time. 
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control. 
(a) Accounting 
(b) Distribution of Rewards and Expenditure Control

Adequate provisions for bad debts had not been made for those balances that were uncertain to recover.

2. Financial Review

3.2. Transactions of Contentious Nature 
The following observations are made.

A sample audit check relating to 06 officers of the Export Division for the three months from January to March 2012 revealed that each officer had been on overtime duty in the ranges of 600 hours to 663 hours in each of the three months.  
Further, the average overtime duty of these officers per day per officer had exceeded 20 hours.  
(b) Those officers had been paid cargo examination fees in an unusual manner in respect of the period for which the above overtime had been paid.  
(c) Even though requests were made to produce the documents to audit in support of the payment of cargo examination fees relating to the Bonds and Baggage Division during February to April 2012, such information was not produced even up to October 2013. 
Though it was reported that the information relating to the Exports Division for the years 2008 and 2009 had been deleted, such information for the year 2010 and 2011 had not been also produced to audit. 
(d) The above overtime and cargo examination fees had been paid in addition to the monthly salaries, incentives, and rewards paid to the officers. 
The overtime earnings of most officers had exceeded their consolidated salaries. 
These payments made to the officers on the basis on being on duty throughout the year without obtaining leave is an unrealistic situation. 
(e) Even though the outdated regulations on overtime and external examination fees should be amended to rectify the above situation no action whatsoever had been taken in that connection. 
3.3. Management Inefficiencies 
The following observation is made. 
The unutilized money of the Fund had been brought forward from year to year as Treasury deposits.

Introduction 
Creating a better society for all the people to live on the basis that all the people living in a country are its citizens, will lead the country towards the development.
There must be a clear path in order to achieve that target.
For instance, we should work within the framework of an appropriate policy.
However, there had not been a policy for social integration in the country and hence the Ministry of National Languages and Social Integration stepped forward to formulate the National Policy for Social Integration.
The objectives of this policy are promoting a sense of responsibility in all citizens as equal partners in the process of promoting social integration and creating a sense of belongingness to the society, creating a society nourished by the pillars of discipline, education and empowerment and strengthening the basis of social integration policy.   
One of the objectives of this process is  identifying the importance of Communication and a common media with a sense of social responsibility as an inter-medium that could contribute towards social integration.

There are several ethnic groups based on race, caste, religious beliefs, cultural background and gender living in the society. 
All these groups and ethnic divides stand united and carry out programmes contributing labour with commitments. 
These programmes are carried out such a way that the benefits of them reach all the people living in the society.

P. S. No. 2014/317 - Third Instalment - Part IV - Funds - Report of the Auditor General 2012 
Customs Overtime and Cargo Examination Fees Fund - 2012 
1. Financial Statements 
1.1. Qualified Audit Opinion 
In my opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in paragraph 1.2 of this report, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Customs Overtime and Cargo Examination Fees Fund as at 31 December 2012 and its financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 
1.2. Comments on Financial Statements 
1.2.1. Presentation of Financial Statements  
1.2.2. Unidentified Transactions  
This had been continuously pointed out in the audit reports for the years 2008 to 2011. 
Though the Director General of Customs stated that action will be taken to rectify that in the subsequent year, no action had been taken even during the year 2012 to settle the matter. 
1.2.3. Accounts Receivable 
The following observations are made.  
Adequate provisions for bad debts had not been made for those balances uncertain of recovery. 
A formal course of action had not been taken even during the year under review for the recovery of the money from the debtors existing for more than 07 years. 
Similarly, action had not been taken to ascertain the existence of certain institution shown as debtors.  
Attention had not been paid to the possibility of identifying and settling those balances. 
(c) Security deposits had not been obtained in connection with certain debtors' balances. 
1.2.4. Special Deposits and Investments 
The following observations are made in this connection. 
(a) The documentary information in support of the purpose of obtaining the deposits had not been furnished to audit. 
(b) Action had not been taken to find out the existence of the depositor of institutions and those deposits had not been confirmed as refundable deposits. 
(c) As this money had been invested in saving accounts over a long period a very low interest had been earned and attention had not been paid to deploy the money in other suitable investments. 
1.2.5. Lack of Evidence for Audit 
Evidence indicated against the following items had not been furnished to audit. 
Item 
Amount 
Rs. 
Evidence not made available 
(a) Sundry Debtors  
Confirmation of Balances relating to outstanding debts of 158 institutions
(b) Eight Items of Accounts
Confirmation of Balances 
1.2.6. Non-compliance with Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decisions 
The following non-compliances were observed. 
Reference to Laws, Rules, Regulations and Management Decision 
Non-compliance 
(a) Financial Regulations 
(b) Public Administration Circular No. 9/2009 of 16 April 2009 and the Sri Lanka Customs Circular No. 01/2010 of 19 February 2010
Even though the punch card machines had been introduced by Sri Lanka Customs, none of the officers of Sri Lanka Customs had used the punch card machine during the year under review and no action whatsoever had been taken in that connection. 
1.2.7. Transactions not Supported by Authority 
Internal regulations had been improperly made for enabling the Customs Officers to obtain overtime allowance exceeding 600 hours per month at 12 to 27 hours per day and the formal approval obtained for that had not been furnished to audit. 
2. Financial Review 
2.1. Financial Results  
This deterioration had been mainly due to the decrease of the income of the Fund by 2.7 percent and the increase of the expenditure by 2.4 percent as compared with the preceding year. 
3. Operating Review 
3.1. Performance 
(a) Overtime Fund 
The money collected as overtime from the external clearance centres and the other institutions to defray the expenditure incurred in the performance of duties during the time in addition to the normal duty times of the Customs Officers and for the performance of duties on the dates in which the Customs is closed for duties is credited to this Fund and the payments made to the customs staff for such overtime service performed are considered as the expenditure of the Fund. 
An analysis of the financial results of the Overtime Fund for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the 09 preceding years is given below. 
Year 
Income  
Expenditure
Surplus   
Improvement/ (Deterioration) in the Financial Results as Compared with Preceding year as a Percentage 
Surplus as a Percentage of the Income 
The following observation is made in this connection. 
(b) Customs Cargo Examination Fees Fund  
Out of the examination fees recovered from the parties who clear the goods for the deployment of Customs Officers outside the normal places of work on examination duty, 50 percent is credited to the Customs Cargo Examination Fees Fund and that money is utilized for the payment of allowances.  
3.2. Transactions of Contentious Nature 
The following observations are made.  
(a) The contentious nature of the overtime payment process of Sri Lanka Customs was continuously pointed out in the previous years' audit reports and overtime had been paid in an unrealistic manner even during the year under review. 
An audit check relating to 06 officers of the Export Division for the three months from January to March 2012 revealed that each officer had been on overtime duty in the ranges of 600 hours to 663 hours in each of the three months.  
Further, the average overtime duty of these officers per day had exceeded 20 hours. 
(b) Those officers had been paid cargo examination fees in an unusual manner in respect of the same period for which the above overtime had been paid.  
(c) Even though requests were made to produce the documents to audit in support of the payment of cargo examination fees relating to the Bonds and Baggage Division during February to April 2012, such information was not produced even up to October 2013. 
It was reported that the information relating to the Exports Division for the years 2008 and 2009 had been deleted from the computer, but such information for the year 2010 and 2011 had not been also produced to audit. 
(d) The above overtime and cargo examination fees had been paid in addition to the monthly salaries, incentives, and rewards paid to the officers. 
The overtime earnings of most officers had exceeded their consolidated salaries. 
Payments were made for many officers on the basis on being on duty throughout the year without obtaining leave, which is an unrealistic. 
(e) Even though the outdated regulations on overtime and external examination fees should be amended to rectify the above situations, no action whatsoever had been taken in that connection. 
3.3. Management Inefficiencies 
The following observation is made. 
The unutilized money of the Fund had been brought forward from year to year as Treasury deposits. 
The balances of the Deposit Account and the balance of the Fund indicated improvement as shown below. 
It was observed that necessary steps had not been taken by discussing the matter with the Treasury.

Overtime Fund 
Cargo Examination Fees Fund 
Balance of the Treasury Deposit Account 
4. Accountability and Good Governance 
Budgetary Control 
It was observed that the budget had not been used as an effective management control, as the budget revealed quantitative variances between income and expenditure, and actual revenue and expenditure.
5. Systems and Controls‍
Deficiencies in systems and controls observed during the course of audit were brought to the notice of the Director General of Customs from time to time. 
Special attention is needed in respect of the following areas of control. 
(a) Arrears of Income 
(b) Overtime Payments 
(c) Accounting 
(d) Container Examinations
